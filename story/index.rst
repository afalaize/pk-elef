The Pink Elephants is the combination of well-crafted electronic sounds and guitar riffs that send. On rhythms ranging from Hip Hop to drum'n bass, the duo carves the sounds live by relying on pachydermic bass. In a psychedelic and absurd atmosphere, the two musicians with the head of elephant embark you with a music that speaks to the body.
